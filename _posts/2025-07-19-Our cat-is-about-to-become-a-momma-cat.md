6:00 am. My morning starts with either our mom’s face or our cat’s face.

Mom’s face — if I look anywhere but at the front door.

And our cat’s face — if my eyes happen to fall on the front door before anything else.

She’s almost always there, meowing loudly for her morning food. I feed her, and she winds down and sleeps through the day, waking only for occasional strolls and meals.

But today was different.

I could hear her meowing all the way from my room — so loud, so persistent, that it was obvious something was off. I gave her food. She ate two-thirds of it, then kept meowing loudly while pacing along the veranda walls, back and forth, stopping on the eastside corner wall.

It was a no-brainer — she wanted me to follow her.

I did. Out the main gate. The road outside was overflowing with rainwater. Inconvenient, sure, but okay. Things happen.

I kept following her, a bit of trial and error here and there, until we reached our destination. Well, near it.

She walked confidently through the gate of another house, but when she saw me hesitating outside, she came back to urge me in. I was reluctant at first — you don’t just walk into someone’s house — but hey, all for our cat. I rang the doorbell and asked the owner, “Has our cat given birth somewhere inside your veranda?”

They said no, but kindly let me follow her in.

And there she was. Sitting quietly in one of the corners of their garden, conveniently hidden from onlookers. She’d found a perfect birthing spot.

There wasn’t much I could do, so I came back home.

I didn’t feel sad that she chose their garden over ours.
A bit, maybe.
But it made sense. That corner was well hidden. Quiet. Safe.

Back at home, I told everyone what had happened.

My brother said I might’ve made a fool of myself by knocking on someone’s door to ask about newborn kittens. In retrospect — yeah, maybe a little. My didi hasn’t stopped laughing since, which is not helping at all.

But they’re both a little concerned too. The last time our cat gave birth, it was painful — expected, but still hard to watch. Didi sat beside her the entire time. Sadly, the kittens didn’t survive.

This time, didi’s busy with work and studies, so it’s on me.

I’m on full-time kitten watch today.

Half an hour after showing me her garden hideout, our cat returned to our veranda.

After some convincing, she settled into the temporary house I’d built for her — a couple of cardboard boxes and one of my old t-shirts. It might not be as good as what she had found, but it’s not bad either.

She’s resting in it now.

But the moment she realizes none of us are in the veranda, she climbs out and starts meowing loudly until someone steps out again to tuck her back into bed.

Let’s see how long this goes on.

I’m literally on patrol today. No fooling around.

I’ll have to stand my ground — even if the monkeys go on rampage.
