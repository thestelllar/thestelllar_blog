I doubt I did anything properly. This whole week was spent signing up for tasks and then, before even making real progress on one, wishing I were working on another <i>important</i> task. And when I finally switched to that other <i>important</i> task, I felt guilty for neglecting the first one—only to end up messing up both.

If it had happened just once, I could have shrugged it off. But every single day of the week? That’s disappointing.

Now what? New week, new me?
