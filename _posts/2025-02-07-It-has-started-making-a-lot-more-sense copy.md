The visa process has started making a lot more sense now. Initially, it seemed so daunting. To be honest, I wanted to run and hide behind my sister, like I’ve always managed to do so far. But this time was different. I couldn’t just go cry in front of her and ask her to figure things out and make them work for me. This was new for her too. Besides, she already has so much on her plate. It would’ve been selfish of me to burden her with more. And anyway, I’m not a <i>mama’s</i>—oops, <i>didi’s</i>—kid anymore. I’ve grown out of that phase. Plus, I have some self-respect. I can’t let her taunt me with—<i>And I thought you wanted to be independent!</i> Who’ll make her understand that there are edge cases everywhere?

By the way, I was honestly considering delegating this task to my younger brother. Had I been oblivious to his excitement about this whole thing, I would have considered it. But I need a visa for me, not him. Just kidding—he has important stuff on his plate too.

I had to turn to other people. I talked to a couple of new people and some old ones too. They helped me understand a lot about the process. Now, things make a lot more sense to me. I have an appointment soon—let’s see how it goes.
