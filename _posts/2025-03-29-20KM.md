Or should I say I wanted another post, thus today’s run?

Anyway, I ran 20 KM today. 🌼

My longest run.

My first <strike>20 KM</strike> <i>half marathon</i>!

Why did this run happen?

Maybe because I had two MSR oranges before the run.

Maybe because I had a not-so-good week.

Maybe because I wanted to write something.

Maybe because I started <i>strong</i> and was running alone—no need to worry about making anyone wait while I finished.

Maybe because I’m leaving soon, and a <i>half marathon</i> before I go just felt right.

Or maybe...
I’m simply getting better and just winged it. XD

p.s. I can’t end without mentioning—I did walk a little in the middle. Just enough to catch my breath, yet still stay true to my run. You know what I mean.

p.p.s. And it was tough—my knees are still filing complaints.
