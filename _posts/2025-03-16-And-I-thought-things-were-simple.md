I think a week of me not disturbing them will set things right.

Things were going decently, and then I interfered. Now, they are not. I had known for some time that my capsicum seedlings were competing for space. Earlier this week, I acted on impulse and tried to set things right by repotting them properly. Not only that, but I also think I overwatered them. That was definitely a bad move. Now, a lot of the seedlings have already died, and a few are shriveling for some reason. A couple of them are still doing fine, but given my mismanagement, I don't know for how long. It’s good that I’ll be away for a week—hopefully, things will start working out between us magically.

On a brighter note, I just noticed that my cactus has been growing too! It has sprouted a cute, tiny bud on its head. Hopefully, when I’m back, there will be a flower in its place. :)
