I do everything — from stopping an invasion by an entire battalion of nine newborn puppies, armed with a hunger that devours satisfaction itself — insatiable, relentless, and always aching for more — and equipped with the deadliest weapon of all: a squeak that could summon their mom in no time; to babysitting our cat while she’s within house premises, lest she slip past my watchful eye and enter the godforbidden place — Mom’s room. It makes me shudder to think of the consequences if I fail in my duty.

Let me describe my battleground in a bit more detail so you can truly empathize with me.

We have a small house, strategically located — with goodness knows what strategy, but it works, hence a strategy. They always find us before we even spot them — these kittens, puppies, and platypuses. Well, platypuses were clearly an exaggeration. I wonder who put that in my head. Anyway, you get the idea.

The cuteness they spread can catch even a man with a so-called stone-heart off guard. What chance do the five of us have? But we can't be swayed by cuteness — the consequences are undesirable. There’s an unsaid rule in our house: any kind of mess, be it organic or inorganic, associated with these invaders must be cleaned up by the person in whose presence the ordeal was committed.

But people being people, they’re not exactly known for following rules. Naturally, there was an opening for a guardsperson, and Mom — being aware of my current job status — appointed me in charge.

Therefore: Guardsperson. Yeah, that’s what I’m these days.

As I mentioned, we have a small house with a small veranda and a small garden in the left corner. Well, it’s not much of a garden — just a patch where a handful of plants try to grow. In the other corner, there’s a small shed where our cat somehow finds space for herself when it’s too sunny everywhere else. There are a couple more things on the veranda, but they’re not of much importance right now.

Our veranda is enclosed by walls on three sides, each no more than a foot taller than me. There’s a main gate built into the wall facing the house. The gate is the same height as the walls — technically a bit taller, since it’s elevated half a foot off the ground. And this gap between the gate and the floor is what’s exploited by these invaders.

Cats, of course, can leap over the walls — no barrier for them. But for puppies, the gate acts as a first line of defence. These puppies clearly haven’t been taking their yoga classes seriously — so despite being smaller than our cat, they get stuck, while she glides freely under the gate, flaunting her flexibility like a feline gymnast.
So far, none of the puppies have successfully breached the first line. Every time they try, they get stuck under the gate — their heads this side, torsos awkwardly wedged outside. As inconvenient as it appears, they still excitedly sniff around and roll their eyes to soak in the surroundings, planning their next move in case they ever knock the defence down.

Well, not on my watch, puppies.

It’s not that I don’t like them — they’re cute. But they’re a <i>lot</i>. And a <i>persistent</i> lot. We can’t favour one over the other, and besides, we’ve already taken our cat under our care. We can’t take more in. And we certainly can’t replace her. That wouldn’t be fair.

We usually feed the puppies a bit farther from the house, so that while they’re busy eating, we can vanish around the corner. Except we didn’t vanish properly — and now our hideout’s been exposed. Worse, they’ve identified <i>me</i>. Now, whenever I take them out for food, I feel very much like the Pied Piper of Hamelin — only with a chapati instead of a pipe, and puppies instead of rats.

And they poop. A lot. And I really don’t want to go around scooping it. So it’s a firm no to puppies inside the house.

As far as puppies are concerned, our first line of defence is more or less sufficient. I still stand guard at the gate during every attempted invasion — to ensure none of them gets awkwardly stuck there.

As for our cat — thanks to our FIFO policy — she enjoys certain privileges. She’s allowed to glide in and treat our veranda like her own, which she claims unabashedly. On special occasions, she’s even allowed inside the house — like when it’s raining outside, or when monkeys are on a rampage.

That’s when I come into the picture.

As part of my job, I have to keep a close eye on her. And in case of any breach in policy — like her casually strolling toward Mom’s room or the kitchen — my duty is simple: umm, well… just scream and call Mom. Our cat doesn’t seem to take me very seriously.

Now, while I may seem to hold no real authority in these situations, I <i>do</i> have some — at least when she’s inside <i>our</i> room. I can, for example, let her rub herself against Didi’s water bottle, or clean her paws and nails on Didi’s yoga mat.

Of course, Didi objects. But that’s fine.

To be precise, she’s okay with the cat playing on her yoga mat — just not with her bottle. Fair enough.

I surrender when monkeys take over. No amount of shooing ever shoos them away — might as well sit back and write another week’s post.

My watch may be questionable — but hey, I never signed up for the monkey shift.
And as for the platypuses — that’s from Phineas and Ferb, which we’ve lately started watching during dinner. I like it.
