Someoneâ€™s new here!
I was wondering what to talk about this weekend. If youâ€™ve been following along, youâ€™ll notice I usually write about one of two things: my plants or my weekend run. The pattern is obvious.
But this week, the running part wasnâ€™t particularly eventful. Not that it makes it any less important to me â€” but if I had to choose, Iâ€™d rather write about something else. For your sake, letâ€™s assume.<br />

So, with running out the window, Iâ€™m left with my plants.<br />

By the way, something interesting <i>did</i> happen that couldâ€™ve easily been the highlight of my week.<br />

Want to know?<br />

My wannabe-capsicum-plant is suddenly growing <i>so many</i> new buds! We might see flowers soon. Isnâ€™t that <i>some</i> news?<br />

But thatâ€™s not even the best part.<br />
I added a new, tiny plant to my collection.<br />
One that I can carry around with me anywhere.<br />
One I can keep near my other plants without making them jealous.<br />
One that pairs beautifully with my monochromatic bag.<br />
One that adds vibrant colors to my otherwise uninteresting wardrobe. <br />
Itâ€™s a sunflower. ðŸŒ» <br />
A crocheted one.
