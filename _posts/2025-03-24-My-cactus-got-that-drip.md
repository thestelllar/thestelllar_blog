Now, listen here. I left my good old cactus, nice and neat, trimmed down just right—simple, respectable, nothing too flashy. And I come back, and what do I see? A whole <i>thing</i> sprouting right on top of its head like some wild, untamed mess. Pardon me.

I squint at it, tilt my head. <i>What in the name of good, proper houseplants is this?</i>

Back in my day, a cactus knew its place. It sat there, quietly, maybe grew a little taller, but never—not once—did it wake up and decide to slap a whole flower on top like it's off to some fancy city gala. What is this new generation up to? Can’t just be a cactus, no, no. Gotta make a statement. Gotta be <i>extra.</i>

And you know what the kids say these days? They say—now, let me get this right... huh? Yeah, that’s what they say.

<i>sighs deeply</i>

Fine.

My cactus got that drip.
