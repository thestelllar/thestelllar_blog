I should probably write now â€” lest I trick myself into thinking nothing out of the ordinary happened this week.

My Di threw me out of our room. Donâ€™t ask me why. She and her exams, her idiosyncrasies, her habit of rubbing me the wrong way â€” always on purpose â€” every single time.

I donâ€™t know how she does it â€” brings out this side of me that unsettles the composure Iâ€™ve lately, and perhaps mistakenly, come to associate with calmness.

Iâ€™ll admit it: she makes me feel valued in the most beautiful way â€” second only to Mom â€” but she also manages to irritate me in the most peculiar ways. She didnâ€™t do much today, just threw me out of our room. But I guess things have been piling up.

And you ask, what sorts of things?

The kind that pisses Mom off â€” not drinking milk on time, delaying breakfast until it becomes lunch, leaving curd untouched from morning to evening, picking out all the good mango pieces (okay, well, Mom might be fine with that, but there are other people too, you know). Basically, <i>not eating properly</i>.

And when Mom is pissed, she does what moms do best â€” taunt at every opportunity. And I have to sit through all of it, even though I drink my milk, eat my breakfast on time, finish my curd then and there, and take whatever mango pieces are left â€” without so much as a complaint.

My brother is good in these regards <i>at least</i>. Weâ€™re on sort-of-agreeable terms.
Though we randomly hit each other, laugh, and then get scolded by Mom, he never bothers to irritate me the way my Di does. I think he thinks heâ€™s the wise one around. But then everyone thinks the same.

Honestly, I donâ€™t know how my Mom handles us all. I can only marvel at her.

Had I been in her position, I wouldâ€™ve lost my sanity long ago.

Still, I love being here. I think this is what I miss when I say I want to go home now.
My siblings are annoying â€” I wonâ€™t deny that. I donâ€™t know how Mom puts up with it all.
Then again, it wouldnâ€™t be a wild guess to assume theyâ€™ve got <i>equally annoying</i> things to say about me.

But hey, this is my corner â€” so thatâ€™s fine.

On a slightly different note, Iâ€™m impressed with todayâ€™s driving experience.
I navigated the city traffic well, properly overtook a couple of vehicles, switched between 2nd and 3rd gear properly, and finally parked decently. ðŸ™‚

And I finished another novel. This one was an audiobook â€” <i>The Sittaford Mystery</i> by Agatha Christie.
I guessed the murderer beforehand. Initially, it was a wild guess, and then I felt confident after I heard an astute old lady character describe the suspect as one with a jealous disposition.
Still â€” a wild guess on my part.

I donâ€™t know why I wrote this. Maybe because, despite my sisterâ€™s warning about locking me out for three hours, I left all my <i>useful</i> stuff inside â€” and I had to do something.

Lately, weâ€™ve started watching old cartoons during our meals.

Weâ€™ve finished all the <i>Mr. Bean</i> episodes available on YouTube and are now going through <i>Phineas and Ferb</i>.

I love how simply they look at life in those episodes â€” and their songs? Absolute gems!

Have a good day ðŸŒ¼
