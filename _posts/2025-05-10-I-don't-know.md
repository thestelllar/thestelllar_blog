I want to live a simple, meaningful and peaceful life.

And, I don't know what that means.

btw, my plants are doing fine. I need to start looking for a new place for them.

Also, lately, I'ven't been running properly. My last <i>proper</i> run was on 27th April 2025. I was supposed to run in TCS 10K Run but the crowd was overwhelming so I instead ran in Cubbon which was looking even more ðŸŒ¸

The week after TCS 10K - I skippped.

And today - I walked.

Maybe next weekend I'll run.
