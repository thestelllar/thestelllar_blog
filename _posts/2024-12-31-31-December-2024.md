It's been a year and a half since I first got acquainted with Bangalore. I
wouldn't claim to have seen it allâ€”far from itâ€”but what I have seen is
undeniably beautiful. The handful of places I've stumbled upon feel like home to
me.
<br />
This morning feels special. I'm at my favorite spot in the office, and today,
the view is simply perfect. The sun is shining brightly, illuminating a mosaic
of towering trees. Most of them appear to be Eucalyptusâ€”Nilgiri, or safeda
trees, as they're also known. There are others whose names I've yet to learn. A
cool breeze is flowing through the scene, setting the leaves into motion. Before
me, it's as if an open dance floor has come alive. The music is loud, and
everyone must join in. Most leaves are already rustling with fervor, while the
shy ones are gently coaxed into the rhythm, swaying hesitantly before fully
surrendering to the occasion. Amidst the lively crowd of leaves, something stirs within me. A familiar nudge. I ease my thoughts, and before I know it, nostalgia has crept in. A smile
spreads across my face as I watch the scene unfoldâ€”a moment so simple, yet
profoundly moving.
<br />
The breeze slows. The music softens, fading into a quiet hum. The shy leaves
keep swaying, lost in their own rhythm, oblivious to the crowd thinning around
them.
<br />
And then, just as suddenly, the music returns. The breeze picks up, and the
leaves, once again, take to the stage, swaying freely in their joyous dance.
<br />
There's a comfort in this rhythm, a sense of belonging that I can't quite put
into words.
<br />
Like I said, this morning feels special.
<br />
It's just like every other morning here.
<br />
Happy New Year.

p.s. I will write every week :) ðŸŒ»
