It has always been hard for me to close one chapter and move on to the next.

MSR is one such chapter.

I know Iâ€™m in a privileged position, excited about what lies ahead, but it still hurts to leave behind something that mattered so much to me.

My time at MSR was truly beautiful. I wonâ€™t talk about the work side today. On a personal note, it gave me the chance to meet so many wonderful people. I feel a pang of sadness knowing those moments are now a part of the past.

Iâ€™m very much on the introverted side, so getting comfortable with new people is a big deal for me. The fact that I can count so many, and even run out of fingers, makes me feel deeply grateful.

Iâ€™m not usually a fan of nostalgia, but it sneaks in sometimes with that bittersweet feeling.

A sad, yet beautiful feeling.

I miss my cat, plants and people. ðŸ¥º

And now, I suppose, itâ€™s time to get back to more useful things.
