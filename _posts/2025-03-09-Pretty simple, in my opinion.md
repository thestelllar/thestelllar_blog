Other than the fact that I have crammed a lot of capsicum seedlings into the same pot, I think things are pretty simple between us.

They droop when they are sad; otherwise, they smile.

I’ve found a perfect spot for my plants—at least for now. They get ample sunlight, <i>good company</i>, and a reasonably sensible person to water them regularly. Yes, that's me.
Though, I mess it up sometimes.

Like last Friday, when I didn't water them properly. By Monday, when I came back, they had all drooped—some more than others, but there was a clear, tangible gloominess in the air. To be honest, I thought that was it. Still, I watered them, hoping it would bring that smile back. And to my amazement, within a couple of hours, they were back to normal—no sign of gloominess at all!

Today, too, when I looked at them, they seemed slightly pissed. A few splashes of water, and they were back to normal.

Pretty simple, in my opinion.
