Itâ€™s been a while since we last talkedâ€”more than a month and a half now. Itâ€™s not that I didnâ€™t have much to talk about. In fact, the last few weeks stand out distinctly from my otherwise mundane routine. And Iâ€™m grateful to all those people who made them memorable for me.

There were times when I thought Iâ€™d sit down and jot things down, but instead, I chose to let things unfold, saving the reflection for some fine day.

Though, today is not that day.

And I doubt that day will ever come nowâ€”partly because thereâ€™s just too much to write if I start, and partly because Iâ€™m not sure it would do any good to dwell on time that has passed and memories that have already been made. I think theyâ€™re <i>almost</i> right where they should be, and any attempt to reorganize them would only lead to further tangles.

Also, Iâ€™m back home now. Iâ€™ll miss Bangalore for everything it gave me, including its traffic and heavy rains. I doubt Iâ€™ll be visiting anytime soon, but I would like to go back somedayâ€”Iâ€™ve left my plants there. Iâ€™m glad I got to see a capsicum growing before I left them with a friend.

I wonâ€™t attach any images today. Iâ€™ll leave that for some other dayâ€”like everything else Iâ€™ve promised before. ;)

Back home, things seem to be moving both too slowly and too quickly at the same time. Sometimes it feels like itâ€™s already been a week; other times, it feels like itâ€™s <i>only</i> been a week.

Iâ€™ve started learning how to drive. I think Iâ€™m doing decently, and hopefully, Iâ€™ll soon be able to drive confidently.

Also, Iâ€™ve started reading again. This time, Iâ€™m planning to read fast. Iâ€™m a bit infamous for reading <i>extremely</i> slowly. I recently finished <i>The Great Gatsby</i> and have started a murder thriller. My mom has lately been complaining about our habit of buying too many books and not reading them fast enough. Iâ€™m planning to finish all the books before I leaveâ€”mine and my sisterâ€™s combined (and my brotherâ€™s too, though heâ€™s not particularly possessive about his books right now, so my sister and I have unofficially claimed most of them).

Besides that, thereâ€™s a cat in our house. Well, not exactly <i>in</i> the houseâ€”she mostly roams around the veranda. Her frequent scuffles with other cats (and sometimes even dogs) say a lot about how possessive she is of our little space.

Initially, I was a bit skeptical about letting her get close to meâ€”partly because of past unpleasant experiences with cats and partly because she was already getting enough love and attention from my mom and siblings (maybe even papa, though Iâ€™m not entirely convinced by his ways of expressing affection. The cat would agree, too). It felt like whatever I could offer would be insignificant and redundant. Yet, after a week here, Iâ€™ve started enjoying her company. I really like it when she silently comes and stands close to me. This is almost always followed by me squeaking and jumping aside, startled by her touch. But it feels good. A bit weird, but good.

I think Iâ€™ve grown a bit fond of her, though Iâ€™m still a little scaredâ€”especially when sheâ€™s not in the mood. I still canâ€™t muster the courage to lift her up like the others do. And Iâ€™ll let it be that way, as Iâ€™ll be leaving soon, and I donâ€™t want another reason to feel sentimental about home.

I want to build my muscle strength tooâ€”and defeat my siblings in arm wrestling.

That was out of the blue.

Iâ€™m planning to build my new website. After all, I need to start appearing a bit more serious now. Iâ€™ll keep all my old pages too and will, hopefully, post regularlyâ€”some random, useless stuff as usual. I prefer keeping the old footprintsâ€”they show the path from when I was naive to when I became just a little less naive. That transition deserves its space too. Anyways, I know none of them will appear perfect when I look back, and Iâ€™ll almost always cringe at the mention of them. ðŸ™‚

What else?

Oh, alsoâ€”Iâ€™ve started learning how to cook. I made <i>karela</i> recently, exactly the way my mom makes it. It turned out well. Next time I cook, I think Iâ€™ll write something about it. I need to save these recipes properly. This might be that place.

I think thatâ€™s all for today.

Iâ€™ll be back here again soon!

Have a good day! ðŸŒ¼
