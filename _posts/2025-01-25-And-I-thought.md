After finishing last week's post I realised there was one more thing I could have talked about. Remembering my remarkable streak from last year—two posts followed by a long, dead silence—I knew better than to jinx my achievement with twice on the same day. So, I strategized and saved it for the coming week. For this week’s post. Interestingly, I do have something more to talk about this week than just feeding off last week's savings.
<br>
Remember, I told you about my to-be capsicum plant in last week’s post? Within a few days, those countless seedlings outgrew their home. It was time to find a new home for them. I had two unused pots which came in a set of three—one of them was already harboring a life: my yellow kalanchoe. It’s doing well, just in case you were wondering. With the pots already at my disposal, all I needed was good quality soil, so I <i>blinked it</i> first thing Friday morning.
<br>
In the evening, some friends and I spread out unused A3-sized sheets to prevent a potential mess from forever adorning my bay. One of us grabbed surgical gloves from our office’s medical kit. Armed with office’s printer A3 sheets supply, a 5KG potting soil mix wrapped in a bright-orange, eye-catching bag that couldn’t possibly be sneaked into the office without turning a few known heads, two <i>buy-one-get-two-free</i> pots, a pair of <i>god-knows-when-it-was-last-needed</i> surgical gloves and a kid’s-knife, we got to work repotting my ambitious to-be capsicum seedlings.
<br>
I think we did a decent job. As a result, I now <i>unofficially</i> own six plants! Let’s see how well they grow from here.

P.S. I’ll save that “one more thing” for another post to maintain my one-post-per-week streak this year. Hopefully, I’ll have many more such “one more things.” 🙂
