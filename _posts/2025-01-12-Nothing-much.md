happened this week. I felt nice.

ðŸŒ¼ Initial 5 KM is the hardest. After that, itâ€™s just about carrying on. I ran 12 KM this week.

ðŸŒ¼ Itâ€™s been a while since I started watching the <i>OG</i> Mahabharat. Now I really know how oblivious I was throughout my college life.

ðŸŒ¼ I like R.K. Narayanâ€™s writing style. It gives me nice homely vibes. Iâ€™m done with <i>Swami and Friends</i>. This week Iâ€™ll start with <i>The Bachelor of Arts</i>. Iâ€™m also inclined towards exploring Indian English Literature. Let me know in case you have some suggestions.

ðŸŒ¼ I <i>unofficially</i> now own 4 plants. My Kalanchoe, a friendâ€™s Money Plant, a wanna-be capsicum plant and another friendâ€™s Cactus. They look nice together.

ðŸŒ¼ A professor reached out to me to discuss my PhD application. Iâ€™m a bit amazed at this gesture. We had a short call. I took the sign and mailed all the other professors too. My DSA preparation is also going on. Letâ€™s see what happens next.

ðŸŒ¼ I really like Bangaloreâ€™s weather.

I should stop eating dates now. My stomachâ€™s aching. :)
