happened this week. I felt good.

ðŸŒ¼ Initial 5 KM is the hardest. After that, itâ€™s just about carrying on. I ran 12 KM this week.

ðŸŒ¼ Itâ€™s been a while since I started watching the <i>OG</i> Mahabharat. Now I really know how oblivious I was throughout my college life.

ðŸŒ¼ I like R.K. Narayanâ€™s writing style; it gives me nice, homely vibes. Iâ€™ve finished <i>Swami and Friends</i>, and this week Iâ€™ll start <i>The Bachelor of Arts</i>. Iâ€™m also inclined towards exploring Indian English Literature. Let me know if you have some suggestions.

ðŸŒ¼ I <i>unofficially</i> own four plants now: my Kalanchoe, a friendâ€™s Money Plant, a <i>wannabe</i> capsicum plant and another friendâ€™s Cactus. They look nice together.

ðŸŒ¼ A professor reached out to discuss my PhD application, and I was a bit amazed by this gesture. We had a short call, and I took it as a sign to email the other professors as well. Meanwhile, my DSA preparation is ongoing. Letâ€™s see what happens next.

ðŸŒ¼ I really like Bangaloreâ€™s weather.

I should stop eating dates now; my stomach is aching. :)
