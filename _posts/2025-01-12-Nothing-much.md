happened this week. I liked it.

Initial 5K is the hardest. After that, it’s just about carrying on. I ran 12 KM this week.

It’s been a while since I started watching the <i>OG</i> Mahabharat. Now I really know how oblivious I was throughout my college life.

I like R.K. Narayan’s writing style. It gives me nice homely vibes. I’m done with <i>Swami and Friends</i>. This week I’ll start with <i>The Bachelor of Arts</i>. I’m also inclined towards exploring Indian English Literature. Let me know in case you have some suggestions.

I <i>unofficially</i> now own 4 plants. My Kalanchoe, a friend’s Money Plant, a wanna-be capsicum plant and another friend’s Cactus. They look nice together.

A professor reached out to me to discuss my PhD application. I’m a bit amazed at this gesture. We had a short call. I took the sign and mailed all the other professors too. My DSA preparation is also going on. Let’s see what happens next.

I really like Bangalore’s weather.

I should stop eating dates. My stomach’s aching now. :)
