I’d heard from Mom that our cat was almost obsessively possessive of our veranda — and of maybe us too. I was skeptical at first — but not anymore.

I didn’t grasp how heavy our three-day absence would feel — not for us, but for our cat. When we got back, she was visibly shaken and hesitant to let us out of her sight. She still is — though now, for a different reason.

She kept meowing at us, as if demanding to know where we’d been for the past three days. To be missed the way we were by our cat — it caught me off guard. Next time I plan a trip for us, I’ll need to plan one for her too.

We think something changed in her during those three days we were away. Now she is more possessive than ever. And the fact that there are two new kittens and four new puppies near our house is driving her absolutely nuts. She’s not ready to share — never was, might never be.

She’s paranoid in the most dramatic, hilarious way. The three of us — my siblings and I — go for a walk after dinner every day. It’s become a ritual now. These days, our cat has started following us too. You might remember — I mentioned in an earlier post that in the initial days once we stepped outside our house’s boundary, she used to blatantly refuse to acknowledge any ties with us. None whatsoever. But now, she doesn’t just acknowledge her ties with us — she puts them into full action. The moment we step out of the house, she slips into spy mode. She rolls on the road, leaps over bushes, darts between flower pots, peeps from beneath parked cars, and hides behind scooters — all in an effort to keep a close eye on us.

What’s funny is, I think she thinks we don’t realize it.

My sister says she is behaving like a nosy, jealous wife.

And honestly, I agree.

As incredible as it sounds, it’s true.

She’s turned our post-dinner walk into something a little more special. 

And, I think she is really cute.🐱
