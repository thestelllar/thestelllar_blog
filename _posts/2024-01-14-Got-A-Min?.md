Got a min? <br>
…<br>
Cool, do you remember the promises I made to 2024?<br>
…<br>
The weekly run one?<br>
…<br>
Yeah, the 15K one.<br>
…<br>
I’m one step closer to it. 6K, it is!<br>
…<br>
<i>(chuckling)</i> with a 100-meter sprint towards the end.<br>
…<br>
Ahh, non-stop too.<br>
…<br>
But with a pace rivaled that of a tortoise finishing a marathon XD.<br>
…<br>
About my other promises?<br>
…<br>
Pretty decent. Not much has changed over the week.<br>
…<br>
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Book by Douglas Adams.<br>
…<br>
Yeah, exercising more or less regularly.<br>
…<br>
Journaling? Doing it in bursts.<br>
…<br>
Umm, pass?<br>
…<br>
<i>(smirk)</i> Well, What else do you think it is? A post for this week.<br>
…<br>
Yeah, see you next week!<br>
