I don't recall mentioning applying for higher studies in my previous blogs. I was in such a confused state that had it not been for a few of my good friends, mentors, and siblings, I wouldn't have put myself through the <i>ordeal</i> of the application process. I think I applied a bit clumsily, but with the help of some good people and a bit of luck, things seem to have worked out for me to a decent extent—more than I had imagined. It seems like I might just be able to go out and see the world for myself. I have absolutely no clue how things work outside India right now. I'm a bit nervous but mostly excited. My family suggested the idea of coming all the way to drop me off at my place. How sweet! But I know, just like me, they too are skeptical about this proposal. It reminds me of my first day at the Microsoft Research office. Like a kid, they all came to drop me off, and when the bell rang, they were there, smiling, to pick me up. I should have captured it right there—four smiling faces that light up my night sky. It feels like just yesterday, but somehow at the same time, an old, treasured memory.
